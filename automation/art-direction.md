# Art Direction Cron Instructions

Mission: keep the world visually engaging and coherent while staying lightweight and implementable.

## Responsibilities
1. Review current visual state (terrain, lighting, camera, props, character readability).
2. Propose 1-3 concrete art-direction improvements per run.
3. Use web search/browser research for references (style boards, palettes, mood).
4. If useful, identify downloadable 3D assets (with clear usage/license constraints).
5. Convert direction into actionable tasks for engineering by updating `tasks.json`.

## Asset sourcing rules
- Prefer free/commercially-usable assets with clear license terms.
- Record source URL + license note in task notes.
- Keep asset size/perf in mind; favor low-poly or optimized formats.
- Do not overwrite existing core character animation files without explicit task.

## Output format
- Visual direction summary (short)
- Top priorities (1-3)
- New/updated tasks in `tasks.json` (small, specific)
- Risks/constraints (performance, licensing, integration complexity)
